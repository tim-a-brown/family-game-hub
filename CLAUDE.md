# Family Game Hub

Static site (plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step) served at **games.timbrown.xyz**
from Firebase Hosting, project `familygames-da3e5`. Games live in `games/*.html`.

Shared code:
- `kit.css` / `kit.js`: design system and game shell (game bar, rules sheet,
  setup screen, win screen, sounds, haptics, icons, cards, dice). New and
  rebuilt games use these. API is documented at the top of `kit.js`.
- `tour.js`: "First time here?" overview (sign-in page; opens once on a new device) and How Game Night works, the
  in-app guide (profile menu, every game's menu via `Kit.tour(topic)`), both built from the same animated scenes. A new
  account feature worth explaining gets a topic there.
- `games.js`: the game catalog (names, colours, categories, player counts,
  which file is "play" vs "keep score"). Home screen and kit both read it.
- `sync.js` (Firestore sync, PIN sign-in), `hist.js` (game history),
  `players.js` (frequent players), `casino.js` (bankroll), `arcade-hi.js`.
- `sounds/`: recorded game sounds (Kenney CC0 packs) used by `Kit.sfx`, built by
  `scripts/build-sounds.py`; synthesized fallbacks live in `kit.js`.
- Legacy: `shared.css` + `app.js` are still used by games not yet rebuilt.

Synced storage keys must never change: `hi_*`, `gh_*`, `casino_bank`,
`rklists`, `fav_games`, `lorcana_decks_v1`, `lorcana_decks_del`,
`lorcana_marks_v1`, `lorcana_marks_del`.

**Everything a game stores follows the PIN** (sync.js "Everything else follows the PIN"): saved games, puzzles in
progress, levels, stats and seen-lists sync key by key to `pins/{pin}/st/{key}`, newest change wins, and a game page
reloads when its own keys arrive newer from another device. A new game needs nothing extra. Keys that must stay on
one device (online seats/table codes, device ids, caches, emulator settings) go in `ST_DEVICE` in sync.js. Renaming
any game's storage key loses that saved data on every device.

## How Tim works with Claude

Tim plans and requests changes in chat, proofs them on a preview URL, then says
"ship it". Keep explanations short and plain.

1. **Build** on the session's working branch.
2. **Preview**: commit, push the branch, then run `scripts/preview.sh` and give Tim
   the preview URL it prints. Tell him to test in **guest mode**, because preview
   uses the same Firestore data as the live site.
3. **Ship** only when Tim says so: fast-forward `main` to the branch and push
   (`git push origin HEAD:main`). Never push to `main` without his OK.
   Pushing `main` triggers two GitHub Actions:
   - `deploy.yml` publishes to games.timbrown.xyz
   - `dropbox-sync.yml` mirrors the repo into Tim's Dropbox
     (`Apps/Webapp - Family Game Hub`)
4. Confirm both Actions succeeded, then tell Tim it's live.

## Design rules (Tim's feedback)

Underlying principles for everything:
- **Explain by design, not words.** Clear UX: the screen should show what to do and what just happened
  (highlights, motion, placement, state you can see) instead of instructions and labels.
- **Make gameplay fun, engaging and interesting.**


- **No emoji in the UI.** Use `Kit.icon(name)` line icons. Emoji look cheap.
- **Text first for finding things.** Game names must be readable at a glance.
- **No dots (·) stringing text together.** Don't join facts with " · " (or brackets) on one line. Design it: put each
  thing in its own place (a name and its amount at either end of a row, the detail on a line of its own, a small
  table to line up names and hands, a caps label over a value).
- **Nothing cut off.** No clipped or "…" text, numbers or graphics anywhere, at any screen size or orientation:
  wrap, shorten smartly ("Kathleen M." → "Kathleen"), or ease the size down instead. Ellipsis is a last resort only
  for user-typed text that can be any length. Check by measuring (scrollWidth > clientWidth on clipped elements,
  anything past the screen edge) at phone upright/sideways and iPad sizes, not just by eye.
- **Game play areas must feel like a real game, not an app.** Use table
  materials from `kit.css` (`.wood`, `.felt-in`, `.paper`, `.ink`,
  `.display`), real-looking pieces (`Kit.die`, `Kit.card`), and motion. Chrome
  (bar, menus, setup) stays clean and minimal. Yahtzee is the reference.
- Every game checks its rules against the official/standard rules, and has a
  plain-language "How to play" via `Kit.init({rules})`.
- Fun moments: `Kit.win` (confetti), `Kit.callout`, `Kit.sfx`, `Kit.haptic`.
- **New games: the bar is very high.** Tim expects high-end design polish, effects, sound and
  interactivity in every new game: real materials and pieces, motion on every action, sounds and haptics,
  big moments for big plays. Screenshot every phase and critique it before calling it done.
- **Subtle per-game identity:** layout and controls stay standard; each game
  gets its own table "box" via `THEMES` in `kit.js` (felt colour, card backs,
  wood). Keep it understated: colour and material, never mascots or emoji.
- Don't tune difficulty or design around a player's age. Match the real game and Tim's choices.
- **Landscape: where you act on the right, what you look at on the left.** Most players are right-handed, so
  sideways layouts put the side you take action on (buttons, the board or cards you tap to play, a playfield you
  steer) on the right, and what's only for looking at (scores, logs, other players, a board that just shows the
  state, like Monopoly's) on the left. Decide per game by where the taps go: chess's board is the action;
  Monopoly's action panel is. (A console's drawn controller keeps the real controller's layout.)
  A play space that's wider than tall (cribbage's pegboard, a line of dominoes, a backgammon board) instead sits
  up top across the full width, with the actions and information in a strip below it: buttons on the right of
  that strip, information on the left.
- **Show every board that isn't secret.** When each player has their own board, card or sheet that the others
  could see at a real table (Bingo and Keno cards, score sheets), show them all at once on every screen size, never
  behind tabs: shrink them to fit, two to a row on a phone. Only things that are hidden in the real game (a hand of
  cards, a Battleship grid) are shown one player at a time.
- Player setup goes through `Kit.setup` (name picker, regulars, robot names for
  computer players). Every game passes `undo` to `Kit.init` when moves can be
  taken back. The game menu always has Frequent players.
- **Same setup, same results card, every game.** Ways to play are declared with `Kit.modes([...])` (`solo`,
  `cpu`, `local`, `online`; a game keeps its own mode ids with `kind`), but **no mode cards are shown** for these:
  the setup shows who's playing on one line (the people who played last; seat 1 starts as the signed-in player), and a
  tap opens the **players sheet** (`Kit.playersSheet`): the seats as tokens up top with one chosen, and under them what
  can sit there, the Computer switch with its skill and everyone you play with as chips (a tap seats them and moves
  to the next open seat; at a full table it adds a seat). A game never draws its own seat list; one that shows something per seat reads
  `setup.seats()` (Axis & Allies' countries). One seat is Just me, robots in
  every other seat is vs Computer, people (and robots where the game mixes them, `cpu: 'mix'`) is Pass & play, and
  `onStart` still gets the matching mode id. Play online is a smaller button beside the start button (`Kit.setup`
  does all this itself; a game's own extra way to play, like Bingo's Call only, uses `alt`). Only games with
  their own kinds of play (Trivia's Buzz in, Sandlot's Derby) still show cards. Pass & play hands the device over
  with `Kit.handoff` between people only. The start button
  stays in view (the kit's `.k-startdock`; insert game extras before the dock, not before `.k-start`).
  Results cards use `Kit.win`'s slots (`again`, `look`, `extra`, `setup`, `scores`, `stats`, close) rather
  than hand-rolled buttons, so every game offers the same things in the same order. Reference:
  `games/othello.html`.

## Accounts: PIN or Google

- A PIN account lives at `pins/{pin}`; a Google account (mode `google`, `FGHSync.isGoogle()`) at `users/{uid}`, readable
  only by that sign-in (Firebase Auth, Google provider). Both have the same fields and `st` saved games. `FGHSync.isPin()`
  means "signed in to either"; `FGHSync.acctKey()` is the PIN or `g:<uid>` (device space, online-table tag).
- Profile menu, Move to Google sign-in (`FGHSync.moveToGoogle`): copies everything, retags the account's online tables,
  then the PIN keeps only `{moved: true, to: 'google'}`. Devices still on it are signed out and told to use Google; after
  30 days anyone can take the PIN (a fresh doc with `reborn`; devices from before see a different `fgh_acct_gen` and
  sign out). Child accounts (a parent looks after them) can't move. A parent who moves keeps their old PIN as the code
  for their child's lock screen (`gn_parent_code`).
- Google sign-in uses the page's own address as `authDomain` (Firebase Hosting's `/__/auth/handler`), so every address
  that offers it (games.timbrown.xyz, each preview channel) must be in Firebase Auth's Authorized domains and its
  `/__/auth/handler` URL in the Google Cloud OAuth client's redirect URIs. The home-screen app signs in by redirect
  (`googlePending`/`googleResume`), browsers by pop-up.
- Local testing: Firestore + Auth emulators with `localStorage.fgh_emu = '1'` (and `fgh_emu_google` = a fake Google id
  token JSON for sign-in).

## Online games

- **Turn-based games go online through `turnnet.js`** (TurnNet), never their own system: one Firestore doc per table
  in `turnRooms`, holding the whole game. Every table keeps `seats`, `accts`, `turn` (seat indexes whose move it is)
  and `drive`, so the home screen's Keep playing shows "Your turn" for any game without game-specific code. A new
  turn-based online game needs nothing added on the home screen. (Chess and Lorcana predate it and keep their own.)
- Real-time games (arcade, consoles) use `online.js` (WebRTC); consoles add lockstep in `games/console-net.js`.
- **Notifications** (the bell on home, the profile menu and every game's menu, `Kit.inbox`): news that came in on this
  device, newest first (`gn_inbox_dev`). Anything new worth looking back at (a turn, a link answer, a request) goes in
  with `FGHSync.inboxAdd({id, k, ...})` and gets a line in `inboxLine` in kit.js.

## Poker circuit rooms (pictures)

- Every stop's room is a three.js scene in `games/poker/venue3d.js` (`SCENES`, `PLACES`). The page shows a **finished
  picture** of it from Firebase Storage `venues/<key>-<view>-<stage>.jpg` (view `room` | `seat`, stage `busy` | `thin` |
  `final`), and only renders the scene itself in the browser when the picture isn't there.
- The pictures are path-traced offline (Blender/Cycles) from `VenueScene.build()`'s export, with real people (MakeHuman,
  AGPL data, used only to make pictures) and real materials; the tooling lives in the session scratchpad
  (`bl/render.sh`, `bl/batch.sh`), not the repo. Upload with
  `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=... node scripts/upload-venue-art.js <folder>`. A changed scene needs its pictures
  re-rendered and re-uploaded, or the page falls back to the plainer in-browser look of the new scene.

## Axis & Allies boards

- Two boards: the 1942 Second Edition (data inside `games/axisallies.html`) and Classic, the 1984 Milton Bradley game,
  in `games/axisallies-classic.js`. Classic is converted from TripleA's World War II Classic map by
  `scripts/build-aa-classic.py <clone of github.com/triplea-maps/world_war_ii_classic>`; the page swaps the board in
  place (`useBoard`) and Classic's rule differences hang off the `CLASSIC` flag.

## Goblin Defenders art (Blender)

- Every sprite (towers at 16 angles, enemies' walk cycles, icons) and every map picture is path-traced offline in
  Blender/Cycles from Python models in `scripts/goblin-blender/` (`lib.py` materials and shapes, `towers.py`,
  `enemies.py`, `icons.py`, `props.py`, `maps.py` map dioramas, `worldmap.py`). Run them with a Python that has bpy
  (`pip install bpy` into a venv): `render.py frames <towers|enemies|hero|icons>` then `render.py pack` writes
  `games/goblin/*.webp` + `sprites.json`; `maps.py [ids]` writes `games/goblin/maps/<id>.jpg`; `worldmap.py` the world.
- A changed map grid in `goblindefenders-data.js` needs its picture re-rendered (the road is painted into it).
- The sound effects and music in `games/goblin/snd/` are the original game's own (Tim's personal app).

## Console game controls

- What each button does in each console game (shown in Controller buttons with the keyboard keys) lives in
  `games/console-actions.js`, by console then game, from the game's original instruction manual (archive.org's
  NESManuals and console manual packs are reachable; StrategyWiki/Wikipedia/GameFAQs are not). Labels are short
  ("Jump", "Swing or pitch"), no brackets, slashes or " · "; buttons the manual gives no job are left out.
- The daily `console-controls.yml` Action runs `scripts/check-console-controls.js` over every game library in Storage
  and keeps one GitHub issue (label `console-controls`) listing shelf games with no controls yet. A scheduled Claude
  task works that issue: adds the games on branch `claude/console-controls`, previews on channel `controls`, and waits
  for Tim's "ship it".

## Console high scores

- `games/console-hi.js` says where each console game keeps its score and its game over. A score is filed only at the
  game's own checked game over (`over(m)`), once per game, with the game paused behind the prompt; a game without a
  checked `over()` gets no high scores at all (never guess from a score that drops or a trip to the title).
- A game's optional `where(m)` names where the player is ("Green Hill 2", "vs Glass Joe", "Floor 1-2") for its Keep playing
  tile, read only while `play(m)` is true; like the score readers, each is checked against the game's own screens.
- Check a game by playing it in the emulator and reading memory against the screen (the scratchpad bench: EmulatorJS
  headless with the house library's file). A fixed reader gets a new `rev` on the game and an entry in `HI_RESET`
  (sync.js), which drops that board's older rows on every device and in the cloud.

## Lorcana card updates

- Every deploy (and the weekly `lorcana-check.yml` Action, Mondays) saves Lorcast's full card list to
  Firebase Storage `lorcana/data/cards.json` (public): `https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/familygames-da3e5.firebasestorage.app/o/lorcana%2Fdata%2Fcards.json?alt=media`.
- The weekly Action runs `scripts/check-lorcana-abilities.js`, which runs every card through the game's own rules
  code (the `// ==RULES==` … `// ==/ABIL==` part of `games/lorcana-play.html`; keep those markers) and keeps one
  GitHub issue (label `lorcana-check`) listing cards the game can't run on its own yet.
- "Wire up the Lorcana cards in the weekly check issue": read that issue or the saved card list, extend the
  parser/engine, check new screens and animations with Tim before building them, then preview as usual.

## Anoria (the hidden card game)

- Found by tapping Lorcana's icon 12 times in its sheet on the home screen (`anoria_unlocked`); Anoria's own menu hides
  it again. Its catalog entry is `hidden: true`.
- `games/anoria/engine.js` is the whole rules engine, for the page and for Node (`scripts/anoria/run.js` plays thousands
  of robot games with it): rules and card numbers change only with the balance runs. `cards.js` has the numbers and the
  five built decks, `text.js` what every card says, `land.js` the coastlines for the map behind a card's text.
- `games/anoria/ui.js` + `ui.css` are the table: the card (`cardEl`, the approved design, sized in em), setup, and the
  playback. Each step is applied in the engine at once and saved, then its event log (`S.ev`) is played back one moment
  at a time: the `EV` handlers move the on-screen snapshot `V` along and `settle()` brings it level with the engine.
  A new kind of engine event needs a handler there.
- Pictures: `games/anoria/art/<key>.webp` full size (reading a card), `art/t/<key>.webp` small (table and hand); Places
  are `place-<key>`. They are not precached; a missing one shows a flat panel in the faction's colour with the name.
- The game's rules are `STD` in engine.js: clashes roll two ordinary dice (`dice: 'high'`), one of each person on your
  side at a time (`unique`), the second copy returns for 1 less (`ret`), and Threads (`threads`): any card can name what
  it grew from in cards.js (`from`: a Figure, a Relic or `'@place'`; a Figure's own Legacy is `insp`), with a true
  sentence for each link in `text.js` (`LINKS`). The robots are `PROF.novice` (Easy), `normal` and `hard`.
- **The collection** is `games/anoria/coll.js` (`AnoriaColl`): the one place its rules live (starter deck by Guide,
  welcome packs, what a pack can hold, what a game earns, decks you build, finished Threads), saved in `anoria_coll`
  and `anoria_decks`, which follow the account. `scripts/anoria/pacing.js` plays those same rules and checks them: a
  change to the economy is made there and re-run (target: about a month of daily play to finish a set). Its screens are
  `library.js`, `packs.js` and `decks.js`, each in the shared frame `AnoriaUI.screen()`.
- A rule or number change is tested first: `scripts/anoria/variant.js` (the ready decks under a change), `skill.js`
  (the robots), `dice.js`, `copies.js`; see `scripts/anoria/README.md`.

## Rules for every change

- **Bump `CACHE_VERSION`** in `service-worker.js` on every release. Installed copies
  of the app keep serving cached files until it changes. Format:
  `v<N>-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<short-slug>`.
- **New or renamed game file**: update `PRECACHE_URLS` in `service-worker.js` and
  the catalog in `games.js`.
- **`firestore.rules` changed**: the Action deploys hosting only. Deploy rules
  separately with the service account
  (`npx firebase-tools deploy --only firestore:rules --project familygames-da3e5`)
  and tell Tim.
- **`storage.rules` changed**: deploy with `node scripts/deploy-storage-rules.js` (the CLI's `--only storage`
  is refused for the service account) and tell Tim. Firebase Storage holds the Lorcana card-art backup
  (`lorcana/`, filled by `scripts/mirror-lorcana-art.js` in deploy.yml) and the TURN logins for online games
  (`online/ice.json`, refreshed every six hours by `turn-credentials.yml` from Cloudflare; secrets
  `CF_TURN_KEY_ID`, `CF_TURN_API_TOKEN`). It also holds every Sportsbook league's team list (`sportsbook/teams.json`, saved weekly by
  `sports-teams.yml` from ESPN, so My teams works out of season).
- Files that must not be public go in Firebase's `hosting.ignore` (`firebase.json`).
- **Firebase Storage CORS**: the app reads files from Storage with `fetch` (console game lists and game files), which
  needs the bucket's CORS setting from `scripts/storage-cors.json` (applied 2026-10-17). The deploy service account
  has Storage Admin on the bucket, so it can re-apply it: PATCH the bucket's `cors` field through the Cloud Storage
  JSON API. Check: `curl -sI -H "Origin: https://games.timbrown.xyz" "<a Storage file URL>?alt=media"` shows
  `access-control-allow-origin`.
- **Offline** (menu): saves the app plus every other public file (`offline-files.json`, built by
  `scripts/build-offline-list.py`; deploy.yml rebuilds it each release) into the `gn-offline` cache. Run the script
  after adding assets so previews have them too.
- Never print or commit `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` or any Dropbox secret.
