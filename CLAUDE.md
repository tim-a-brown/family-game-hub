# Family Game Hub

Static site (plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step) served at **games.timbrown.xyz**
from Firebase Hosting, project `familygames-da3e5`. Games live in `games/*.html`.

Shared code:
- `kit.css` / `kit.js`: design system and game shell (game bar, rules sheet,
  setup screen, win screen, sounds, haptics, icons, cards, dice). New and
  rebuilt games use these. API is documented at the top of `kit.js`.
- `games.js`: the game catalog (names, colours, categories, player counts,
  which file is "play" vs "keep score"). Home screen and kit both read it.
- `sync.js` (Firestore sync, PIN sign-in), `hist.js` (game history),
  `players.js` (frequent players), `casino.js` (bankroll), `arcade-hi.js`.
- Legacy: `shared.css` + `app.js` are still used by games not yet rebuilt.

Synced storage keys must never change: `hi_*`, `gh_*`, `casino_bank`,
`rklists`, `fav_games`, `lorcana_decks_v1`, `lorcana_decks_del`,
`lorcana_marks_v1`, `lorcana_marks_del`.

## How Tim works with Claude

Tim plans and requests changes in chat, proofs them on a preview URL, then says
"ship it". Keep explanations short and plain.

1. **Build** on the session's working branch.
2. **Preview**: commit, push the branch, then run `scripts/preview.sh` and give Tim
   the preview URL it prints. Tell him to test in **guest mode**, because preview
   uses the same Firestore data as the live site.
3. **Ship** only when Tim says so: fast-forward `main` to the branch and push
   (`git push origin HEAD:main`). Never push to `main` without his OK.
   Pushing `main` triggers two GitHub Actions:
   - `deploy.yml` publishes to games.timbrown.xyz
   - `dropbox-sync.yml` mirrors the repo into Tim's Dropbox
     (`Apps/Webapp - Family Game Hub`)
4. Confirm both Actions succeeded, then tell Tim it's live.

## Design rules (Tim's feedback)

- **No emoji in the UI.** Use `Kit.icon(name)` line icons. Emoji look cheap.
- **Text first for finding things.** Game names must be readable at a glance.
- **Game play areas must feel like a real game, not an app.** Use table
  materials from `kit.css` (`.wood`, `.felt-in`, `.paper`, `.ink`,
  `.display`), real-looking pieces (`Kit.die`, `Kit.card`), and motion. Chrome
  (bar, menus, setup) stays clean and minimal. Yahtzee is the reference.
- Every game checks its rules against the official/standard rules, and has a
  plain-language "How to play" via `Kit.init({rules})`.
- Fun moments: `Kit.win` (confetti), `Kit.callout`, `Kit.sfx`, `Kit.haptic`.
- **Subtle per-game identity:** layout and controls stay standard; each game
  gets its own table "box" via `THEMES` in `kit.js` (felt colour, card backs,
  wood). Keep it understated: colour and material, never mascots or emoji.
- Player setup goes through `Kit.setup` (name picker, regulars, robot names for
  computer players). Every game passes `undo` to `Kit.init` when moves can be
  taken back. The game menu always has Frequent players.

## Rules for every change

- **Bump `CACHE_VERSION`** in `service-worker.js` on every release. Installed copies
  of the app keep serving cached files until it changes. Format:
  `v<N>-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<short-slug>`.
- **New or renamed game file**: update `PRECACHE_URLS` in `service-worker.js` and
  the catalog in `games.js`.
- **`firestore.rules` changed**: the Action deploys hosting only. Deploy rules
  separately with the service account
  (`npx firebase-tools deploy --only firestore:rules --project familygames-da3e5`)
  and tell Tim.
- **`storage.rules` changed**: same, `--only storage`. Firebase Storage holds only the
  Lorcana card-art backup (`lorcana/`), filled by `scripts/mirror-lorcana-art.js` in deploy.yml.
- Files that must not be public go in Firebase's `hosting.ignore` (`firebase.json`).
- Never print or commit `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` or any Dropbox secret.
