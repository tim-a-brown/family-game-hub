# Family Game Hub

Static site (plain HTML/CSS/JS, no build step) served at **games.timbrown.xyz**
from Firebase Hosting, project `familygames-da3e5`. Games live in `games/*.html`;
shared code is `shared.css`, `sync.js` (Firestore sync, PIN sign-in), `players.js`,
`hist.js`, `casino.js`, `arcade-hi.js`, `app.js`.

## How Tim works with Claude

Tim plans and requests changes in chat, proofs them on a preview URL, then says
"ship it". Keep explanations short and plain.

1. **Build** on the session's working branch.
2. **Preview**: commit, push the branch, then run `scripts/preview.sh` and give Tim
   the preview URL it prints. Tell him to test in **guest mode**, because preview
   uses the same Firestore data as the live site.
3. **Ship** only when Tim says so: fast-forward `main` to the branch and push
   (`git push origin HEAD:main`). Never push to `main` without his OK.
   Pushing `main` triggers two GitHub Actions:
   - `deploy.yml` publishes to games.timbrown.xyz
   - `dropbox-sync.yml` mirrors the repo into Tim's Dropbox
     (`Apps/Webapp - Family Game Hub`)
4. Confirm both Actions succeeded, then tell Tim it's live.

## Rules for every change

- **Bump `CACHE_VERSION`** in `service-worker.js` on every release. Installed copies
  of the app keep serving cached files until it changes. Format:
  `v<N>-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<short-slug>`.
- **New or renamed game file**: update `PRECACHE_URLS` in `service-worker.js` and
  the game lists in `index.html` and `hub.html`.
- **`firestore.rules` changed**: the Action deploys hosting only. Deploy rules
  separately with the service account
  (`npx firebase-tools deploy --only firestore:rules --project familygames-da3e5`)
  and tell Tim.
- Files that must not be public go in Firebase's `hosting.ignore` (`firebase.json`).
- Never print or commit `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` or any Dropbox secret.
